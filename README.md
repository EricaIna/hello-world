# About me
Hi my name is Erica. I originally from Japan, and I have been living in UK since 2021.

# What I like 
In my free time, I enjoy going for walks and exploring new areas in London.
I love coffee, especially when it's single origin. 
I have diverse hobbies, including visiting museums, watching musicals, Karaoke, cooking, and skiing.

# My personal goal
Leaning tech is a new experience for me. With a background in medicine, I hope to create some medcal-related systems, and user interfaces. Working in a health tech job is my current.
